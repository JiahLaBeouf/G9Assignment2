# Project Details

The aim of this lab is to understand the theoretical concepts from this course. Assembly language will be used to see how the microcontroller system works. It will focus on performing 4 main aspects: Handling of information in memory, interacting with a 7-segment display, using the serial interface of the 68HCS12, and using the hardware timer. Finally, all the knowledge of the 4 aspects will be integrated to perform some more complex functions.
